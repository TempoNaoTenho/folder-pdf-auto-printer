"""Prints PDF files added to a folder using SumatraPDF.

This script monitors a folder for new PDF files and prints them using
SumatraPDF. It runs in the background and can be stopped by pressing
Ctrl+C.

The script uses a queue to store the files to be printed and a separate
thread to print the files. This allows the script to continue running
and monitoring the folder while the files are being printed.

Obviusly, this script requires SumatraPDF to be installed and configured to print
to the default printer.
